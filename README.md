## Carbon Points
Carbon Points is an app to gamify alternative means of transportation, such as using public transportation and riding a bike. It gives you a score based on how long you spend biking and riding public transportation in comparison to how long you spend in the car.

## Building
The files in the /api folder require python3, flask, and mongodb to run. The files in the /app folder need to be compiled using Flutter.
